# VGG16-CAM Image Interpreter

## Overview
Explore the inner workings of the VGG16 neural network as applied to image processing. This project delves into the Class Activation Map (CAM) techniques and guided backpropagation to demonstrate how deep learning models visualize and interpret image data.

## Features
- **VGG16 Utilization**: Uses the VGG16 model, a robust architecture pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.
- **Class Activation Mapping**: Implements Grad CAM to highlight regions of interest in images that influence neural network outputs.
- **Guided Backpropagation**: Examines how specific image features contribute to the classifications made by the model.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Python 3.6 or newer
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
